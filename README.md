# PCD-Actors

This project is a mock system for an Actor System simulation. It was forked 
from the [Ricardo Cardin's repo](https://github.com/rcardin?tab=overview&from=2016-08-01&to=2016-08-31&utf8=%E2%9C%93).
The original project can be found at the following [link](https://github.com/rcardin/pcd-actors).
